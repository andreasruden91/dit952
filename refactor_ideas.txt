1. Make CarController not have any static data. - DONE

2. Make CarView not depend on CarController.
   Have event handlers in the view, that the view invokes when a user action (button press)
   happens. The Controller registers listeners for the events when it makes the view, and
   when one of them triggers it updates the model & view accordingly.

3. frame.drawPanel.repaint(); // WRONG, directly referencing DrawPanel

4. Rename Vehicle -> Vehicle                    - DONE

5. Add Car, Truck, Boat as abstract classes     - Done
